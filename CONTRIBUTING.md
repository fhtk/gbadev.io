## Building and using

There is a script to build the website, `util/makesite.ts`. All of the stuff in `src/` are the sources for the website. `npm build` will build the site using this script, outputting it as a static website into `build/` by default. `npm clean` cleans the build directory. `npm rebuild` cleans and then builds. This build process will output HTML files without extensions, so be sure to inform the web server about that with MIME types.

## Website structure

The site’s structure is laid out in `src/endpoints.json`. Its structure should be somewhat obvious, but in any case there is a TypeScript interface that can serve as a poor man’s schema in `util/makesite.ts`.

## Repository source layout

There are three main subdirectories of `src/`: one for code, one for markup and one for style. Handlebars templating and Sass are currently supported, however there is no TypeScript or Babel processing yet for the client side. Addtionally, the `src/markup/` folder is further divided by `page/` and `partial/`; the former contains full pages, while the latter contains partials for use in templating pages.
